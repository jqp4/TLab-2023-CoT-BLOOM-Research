Direct variation Some puzzles require finding a number or quantity that when added or subtracted from another number or quantity, yields a solution. The operation to perform is specified, then the two numbers or quantities (which may be words describing the solution rather than numbers) are listed, with either a colon or an \"x\" between them indicating the operation to perform. As an example, consider this problem:  Both 2 and 7 are odd numbers, so the only common factors of 2 and 7 are 1 and 7. The problem, therefore, requires finding a number that is equal to 1 plus half of 7, which can be accomplished by subtracting 3.5 from 7.  Mathematical statement The relationship between the two quantities is expressed as a ratio, and the ratio is not changed by reversing the order of the quantities. The ratio with which the ordering is not changed is called the conjugate ratio.  The conjugate ratio is expressed as the fraction:     which is the reciprocal of the fraction:     that defines the relationship between the two quantities.  Thus when the problem is expressed in its simplest form, the relationship between the two quantities is as follows:  Solution  Each of the quantities involved in the problem statement can be expressed in terms of the conjugate ratio.

If we assume that the chef initially had an odd number of apples, then he must have had 16 apples if he has 4 apples left. On the other hand, if we assume that the chef initially had an even number of apples, then he must have had 15 apples if he has 4 apples left.  These problems are very tedious to solve. However, if you draw a tree diagram, it will be much easier to find the answer. Take the apple problem for example. If you draw a tree diagram, you will see that there are two nodes in the tree for 15 apples. Since we do not know whether the chef had 15 or 16 apples, we must take both possibilities into account. Now draw another tree diagram for 16 apples. Since we know that the chef can only have 16 or 15 apples, and he has 4 apples left, we can draw a tree with a node for 4 apples and two nodes with five apples each. This gives us a total of three nodes including the node for 4 apples. This means that the chef initially had 16 apples.  Node method  The node method is just a variation of the tree method.

For example, the question \"A package had eighteen cookies in it. After eating some there were nine left. How many were eaten?\" The student is asked to solve for the variable \"n\".  The student can solve for the variable \"n\" by choosing a value for the number of cookies in the package to begin with (we'll say 20).  Dimensional analysis: There are 20 cookies in the package and 18 cookies are eaten.  This means 2 cookies are left.  The equation is 20 cookies = 18 cookies eaten + 2 cookies left over.  The student can then set up the equation with the known values, solve for the unknown value of \"n\" and then check their answer.   20 cookies = 18 cookies eaten + 2 cookies left over 20 cookies - 18 cookies eaten = 2 cookies left over 2 cookies left over = 2 cookies left over  Check:  20 - 18 = 2 cookies  The student can graph both equations on the same set of axes to confirm their results.  In the example above, the student has used the equation 20 - 18 = 2.  While this is a correct way to solve the equation, it does not explain where the student got the numbers 20 and 18 from.

Alternatively, she could've sold those 6 DVDs for $6 each. Then, she would have $13 - 6 \u00d7 $6 = $13 - $36 = -$23, which is not good.

These problems may either increase or decrease and practice using inverse operations. The solution to direct variation problems is a number representing how many times the stated unit is contained in the solution.  Examples:  Ted drank twice as much orange juice as he did milk. How many glasses of each did he have?  Carlos walked 4 2/3 miles. Express this distance as a number of kilometers.  Estimation  Estimation is a process of guessing the missing number in a sequence. Students guess the missing number then plug the number into the equation to check if their guess is reasonable. As with word problems, estimation can involve numbers, algebra, measurement, geometry, and data analysis. This process typically involves a mental calculation.  Measurement For measurement, students are required to read a ruler or a measuring tape. This also tests students' ability to estimate the length of an item.  Students are asked to use units of measurement of length such as cm, m, or in, or fractions and decimals of the meter, or other forms of measurement such as pounds and ounces.

Alternative method  An alternative method which is useful for comparing measurements that have been rounded off, or measurements in which it is not known which is the larger unit, is to list all known measurements in a decreasing order of size. For example:   Mary is 157\u00a0cm tall.  Tom is 180\u00a0cm tall.  In this example, it is clear that Mary's height is smaller than Tom's. A useful fact to remember is that any number on the list can be used to give the heights of the people in a different order, so that Tom's height will always be bigger than Mary's. For instance, if we subtract 157 from 180\u00a0cm, we get 23\u00a0cm, which we can then add to Mary's height of 157\u00a0cm to give the slightly shorter height of 160\u00a0cm. Another way of subtracting Mary's height from Tom's would be to add 180\u00a0cm to 157\u00a0cm, giving a total of 335\u00a0cm.

Solution to the general problem A more general problem would be to calculate the number x such that:  The trick is to realize that x is the shirt-sleeves in the wash plus the shirt-sleeves not in the wash. That is, add the two fractions with the same denominator (the shirt-sleeves) to get the total number of shirt-sleeves. Solve for x:     and we get the answer:     Therefore, x = 35 shirt-sleeves.

Then the minimum number of packages that both of them shipped on that day is 18 - 11P + 11Q. If we let M be the minimum number of packages that both of them shipped on that day, then we have 18 - 11P + 11Q = M. Solving for P gives us 11P + 18 - M = 0. Solving for M gives us 11P - 18 + M = 0.  Since both sides are equal to 0, it tells us that as long as 11P - 18 is equal to 0, the equation will have a solution, i.e., there will be a number of packages both of them shipped on that day such that the number of packages Sarah shipped on that day is equal to the number of packages Ryan shipped on that day.
