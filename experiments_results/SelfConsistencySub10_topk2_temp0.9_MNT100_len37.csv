Mr. Sanchez found out that 40% of his Grade 5  students got a final grade below B. How many of his students got a final grade of B and above if he has 60 students in Grade 5?,"[' The number of students with final grade B and above is the number of students with a final grade of B or above.\n40% of 60 is <<0.4*0.6>>20.\nSo, 20/60 = <<0.2*0.6>>3.\nSo, the number of students with a final grade of B and above is 3.\n\nA:\n\nThe answer is\n\n 12\n\nBecause\n\n the blue light bulb comes on every 2 seconds so it will be on after 2,4,6', ' 40% = 40/60 = <<4/6>>4/6.\nSo, 40% of his students got a grade below B.\nSo, <<4/6>>4/6 of his students got a grade below B.\nSo, 60% of his students got a grade above B.\nSo, 60 - <<4/6>>4/6 = 60 - <<4/6>>4/6 = 60 - <<4/6>>4/6 = 60 - <<4/6>>4/6.\nSo, <<4/6>>4/6 =']","Since 40% of his students got below B, 100% - 40% = 60% of Mr. Sanchez's students got B and above.
Thus, 60 x 60/100 = <<60*60/100=36>>36 students got B and above in their final grade.

"Lisa, Jack, and Tommy earned $60 from washing cars all week. However, half of the $60 was earned by Lisa. Tommy earned half of what Lisa earned. How much more money did Lisa earn than Tommy?","[' Lisa earned half of $60, which is $<<60/2=30>>30. Tommy earned half of what she earned, so he earned half of $30, which is $<<30/2=15>>15.\nLisa earned more than Tommy because $60 - $<<60/2=30>>30 = $<<60-30=30>>30.\nThe answer is 30\n\nQ: A man has a number of coins. If he takes away one coin from every three coins he has, he', ' Let x be the amount of money earned by Lisa and y be the amount of money earned by Tommy.\nLisa earned $60, so x = 60\nTommy earned half the money earned by Lisa, or half of 60. So, y = 30\nWe know that x + y = 60, so x + y = 60\n60 = x + y\nx + y = 60\nx = <<60-30=30>>30\ny = <<60-30=30>>30\n']","Lisa earned $60 * 1/2 = $<<60*1/2=30>>30.
Tommy earned $30 * 1/2 = $<<30*1/2=15>>15.
Lisa earned $30 - $15 = $<<30-15=15>>15 more than Tommy.
