So the probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1,000 is the probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 999. So the probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1,000 is the probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 998. So the probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1,000 is the probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 997.
