I can't say that I've ever seen a resource like this, but I have seen tons of resources that teach problem solving in a way that is more complex than these examples. I think you'll have to be careful about the language you use to describe the problem solving process, as it may be different than what the students are used to. For example, when you say \"find the difference\", it's not clear to me what you mean. Is it the difference between the number of trees and the number of trees planted? The difference between the number of trees and the number of trees in the grove? The difference between the number of trees and the number of trees that were planted?  I also think that it's important to make sure that the student is able to use the language of the problem to describe the problem, and not just the numbers. It's easy to see that the number of computers in the room is 9 more than it was before, but it's much harder to see that the number of computers is 9 more than it was before.  I think that it's also important to make sure that the students are able to do more than just solve the problem. I think that you should also have the students explain how they got the answer. For example, they could say \"I subtracted the number of cars in the parking lot from the number of cars that arrived.\" or \"I subtract", "Sandy grew 6 carrots. Sam grew 3 carrots.

If you ask me, the most natural interpretation of the question is that it's asking for the number of trees planted in total. The answer to that question is, of course, 21 - 15 = 6.

The answer is 5.   I'm having trouble with this one. I'm thinking it should be 6 because there were 3 cars in the parking lot already and then 2 more arrived. X 2 1 2 It's a trick question. It's possible that the 2 cars that arrive are the same car. X 3 2 1 I'm not sure if I understand. In this case, you're saying that the two cars that arrived are the same car? X 4 3 2 Yes. It's a trick question. The question is written in a way that suggests that there are 3 cars in the parking lot, and 2 more arrive. The problem is that the 2 more that arrive could be the same car. X 5 4 1 Thank you for explaining, but I'm still having trouble understanding. Can you show me an example of how it would be the same car? X 6 5 2 Sure. Take the picture of the parking lot.

There are a lot of ways to write things, and which one is the best for the situation depends on the situation.  There's no way to tell you which way is the best way to write a math problem, because there are a lot of ways to write a math problem.  You're going to have to experiment with different ways to write the problem, and figure out which one is the best.

I've been doing this type of math for years and I still had trouble explaining it. X 5 0 4 I'm a math tutor. I've found that the best way to explain it is to give them a real life example that they can relate to.  For example, if they're having trouble with the concept of subtracting, ask them how much money they have in their wallet. Let's say they have $10. Then ask how much they would have if they went to the store and spent $5. They'll say $5. Then ask them what they would have left. They'll say $5.  Then ask them what they would have if they spent $10. They'll say $0. Then ask them what they would have if they spent $20. They'll say $0.

For example, is this a competition where you are given a problem and you have to solve it on the spot?  Or is this a competition where you get a problem and you have time to think about it and write out your solution?  If you are given a problem and have time to think about it, then I would recommend you to use a strategy called \"backsolving\".  This strategy involves solving the problem backwards.  So, for example, if you are given the problem \"If a tree falls in the forest, and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?\"  You can solve this problem by asking yourself \"If a tree falls in the forest and makes a sound, then there is someone around to hear it. What does that mean?\"  The answer is that the tree fell in town, and there was someone around to hear it.  So, you can backsolve this problem by starting with the answer and working backwards.  So, you can start with the answer \"The tree fell in town\" and ask yourself \"What does that mean?\"  The answer is that it", "Mary had 52 dollars before buying the pie. Her friend had 43 dollars.

Each card has a number on it from 1 to 10. All the numbers are different. He turns over 3 cards. What is the probability that he has a full house? A : The probability that he has a full house is the number of ways he can have a full house divided by the number of ways he can have at least 3 cards. The number of ways he can have a full house is 10 * 9 * 8 = 720. The number of ways he can have at least 3 cards is 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 = 2,592. So the probability is 720 / 2,592 = 0.294.
