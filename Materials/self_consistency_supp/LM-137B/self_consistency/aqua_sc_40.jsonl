Therefore, the time when the angle of elevation is 100\u00b0 is 100\u00b0 = 60\u00b0 + 70.  Therefore, the time when the angle of elevation is 105\u00b0 is 105\u00b0 = 60\u00b0 + 80.  Therefore, the time when the angle of elevation is 110\u00b0 is 110\u00b0 = 60\u00b0 + 90.  Therefore, the time when the angle of elevation is 115\u00b0 is 115\u00b0 = 60\u00b0 + 100.  Therefore, the time when the angle of elevation is 120\u00b0 is 120\u00b0 = 60\u00b0 + 110.  Therefore, the time when the angle of elevation is 125\u00b0 is 125\u00b0 = 60\u00b0 + 120.

So the angle of elevation is 45\u00b0. So \u03b8 = arctan (x / x). So the opposite side is equal to adjacent side. Now, the angle of elevation is 60\u00b0. So \u03b8 = arctan (x / x). So the opposite side is equal to adjacent side. Now, the angle of elevation is 45\u00b0, so the angle of elevation is 45\u00b0. So \u03b8 = arctan (x / x). So the opposite side is equal to adjacent side. Now, the angle of elevation is 60\u00b0, so the angle of elevation is 60\u00b0. So \u03b8 = arctan (x / x). So the opposite side is equal to adjacent side. Now, the angle of elevation is 45\u00b0, so the angle of elevation is 45\u00b0. So \u03b8 = arctan (x / x).

When the angle is 60\u00b0, the car is at a height of (60\u00b0 / 90\u00b0) * the height of the tower. So the height of the tower is (60\u00b0 / 90\u00b0) * ((45\u00b0 / 90\u00b0) * the height of the tower) = (60\u00b0 / 90\u00b0) * the height of the tower. So the answer is (d)."], "answer": "(a)"}

X 1 0 1 Is there any way to get around it?   Nope. You're stuck with it. X 2 1 0 That's disappointing. I wish they would have added a skip feature. X 3 2 2 I've heard people say that the intro is supposed to be a loading screen.

We know that when they meet, the distance is 50 miles. We also know that it takes 12 minutes to travel that 50 miles at a speed of 12 mph. So the equation is 50 miles = (12 minutes)(12 mph). This means that 50 miles = 720 minutes. Now we need to find the distance for the second car. We know that it takes the second car 13 minutes to travel that 50 miles at a speed of 13 mph. This means that 50 miles = (13 minutes)(13 mph).

I'm going to assume that the person is traveling at a constant velocity of 20 km/hr.  So, the distance traveled is given by  d = 20t  where t is the time.  The time taken to reach the destination is given by  t = d/v  where v is the velocity.  So,  t = 2.5h  and  d = 20t  So,  d = 2.5h * 20t  Now, the distance you need to travel is given by  d = (x + 20t)  where x is the distance from the starting point.  So,  d = (x + 20t) - 20t  And,  d = x - 20t  So,  d = 2.5h * 20t - 20t  So,  d = 2.5h * 20t  And,  d = 50  So, the distance traveled is 50 km.

So the space shuttle travels 680m in 40 seconds. Now, if the space shuttle travels at a rate of 17m/s for 5 seconds, it will travel 17m in 5 seconds. So the space shuttle travels 680m in 40 seconds and 17m in 5 seconds. So the total distance traveled by the space shuttle is 680m + 17m = 697m. So the length of the space shuttle is 697m.

Then A's share is Rs.40,000 + 2(x - 375,000) = Rs.x + 375,000 - 7x. B's share is Rs.60,000 + 2(x - 375,000) = Rs.x + 375,000 - 9x. C's share is Rs.120,000 + 2(x - 375,000) = Rs.x + 375,000 - 12x. Now, A gets his share first. So, x + 375,000 - 7x = Rs.40,000. This means that x = Rs.375,000 - 40,000 = Rs.300,000. So, B gets his share after 2 months. So, x - 9x = Rs.60,000. This means that x = Rs.375,000 - 9(60,000) = Rs.3,75,000. So, C gets his share after 8 months. So, x - 12x = Rs.120,000. This means that x = Rs.375,000 - 12(120,000) = Rs.3,75,000.

X 1 0 1 Is this for a high school competition? X 2 1 0 Yes X 3 2 1 I'm assuming you're a junior. I'm not sure if you're allowed to use a graphing calculator or not, but if you are, the answer to the first question is really easy. Just graph the equation y = -2x^2 - 4x + 2 and find the x-intercepts.  For the second question, I'm not sure what they're looking for. Is it the minimum distance traveled? The maximum distance traveled? I'm not sure.  The third question was pretty simple. Find the average of the numbers and then add 10 to each number. The average will be 10 higher.  The fourth question was also pretty simple. You're given that a/b = 3/4. So b = 4a/3. You're also given that 8a + 5b = 22. So 8a + 5(4a/3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a/3 = 22. This simplifies further to 44a/3 = 22. So a = 3/2.  The fifth question was a little tricky. You're given that the numbers go from 1 to 500. There's a pattern to the numbers. There are 9 one-digit numbers, 90 two-digit numbers, and 401 three-digit numbers. So the total number of keystrokes is 9 + 90(2) + 401(3) = 1392.  The sixth question was also pretty simple.

So if you have a problem that asks for the average of 15 numbers, then the smallest possible answer is (a) 50. If the question asks for the distance traveled, then the smallest possible answer is (e) 50.  Then you can work backwards. If the answer is 50, then the mean of 15 numbers is 50 / 15 = 3.333. If the answer is 50, then the distance traveled is 50 kilometers.  The other way to approach these problems is to work forwards. If the question asks for the mean of 15 numbers, then the answer is the sum of 15 numbers divided by 15. If the answer is 50, then the sum of 15 numbers is 50 * 15 = 750. So the mean of 15 numbers is 750 / 15 = 56.25.  If the question asks for the distance traveled, then the answer is the distance traveled divided by the time traveled. If the answer is 50, then the distance traveled is 50 kilometers. If the answer is 50, then the time traveled is 50 kilometers / 20 kilometers per hour = 2.5 hours.  The key to these problems is to recognize the pattern. The answers are always the smallest number, the next smallest number, the next smallest number, and so on.

Liverpool won the competition for the first time (despite having reached two finals previously), beating Leeds United 2\u20131 after extra time in the final at Wembley.  Matches were scheduled to be played at the stadium of the team named first on the date specified for each round, which was always a Saturday. Some matches, however, might be rescheduled for other days if there were clashes with games for other competitions or the weather was inclement. If scores were level after 90 minutes had been played, a replay would take place at the stadium of the second-named team later the same week. If the replayed match was drawn further replays would be held until a winner was determined. If scores were level after 90 minutes had been played in a replay, a 30-minute period of extra time would be played.  Calendar  Results  First Round Proper  At this stage clubs from the Football League Third and Fourth Divisions joined those non-league clubs having come through the qualifying rounds. Matches were scheduled to be played on Saturday, 14 November 1964. Nine were drawn and went to replays two, three or four days later. Of these, four ties were settled at the second replay, with the other going to a third.  Second Round Proper  The matches were scheduled for Saturday, 5 December 1964. Eight matches were drawn, with replays taking place later the same week. The Preston North End\u2013Newcastle United match went to a second replay, which Preston won at Old Trafford on the 21st, but this was still not settled by the time the third replay, again at Old Trafford, took place on the 29th.
